# Moustache Republic Hiring Test
A developer hiring test for MoustacheRepublic, by @Sam-JR-Milburn (sam.jr.milburn@gmail.com).
Hope you like it! I'm a backend guy with undergrad cybersec skills, so this is a little new to me.

## Setup instructions
This is a next.js + React + Javascript (JSX) + HTML/CSS Web Application.
It has the structure and source code to run, but requires initialisation.
You must:
  Navigate (with a terminal) to /moustacherepublic.
  You must type 'npx create-next-app@latest'.
  Every option should be 'No' except:
  You must also enter 'Yes' 'to Would you like to use App Router? (recommended)'.

## Run Instructions
To run, type then enter 'npm run dev' in the terminal in '/moustacherepublic'.
This will initialise and start the server with default configuration at the web address localhost:3000.
Enter localhost:3000 in your browser to visit.

## Remarks
Sorry this took a while, I was on holiday and capping off my 3D Engine, and I've had to teach myself
a bunch of webdev while doing this, and I realised my node/npm/nvm setup was broken
so I had to remove them and fully reinstall.
